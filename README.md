🕹️ Simon Game 🎮
Welcome to the **Simon Game repository!** This is a modern take on the classic memory game where players must remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors.

### 📝Game Overview

In the Simon Game, players need to remember a sequence of colors that light up in a specific order. Each level, a new color is added to the sequence, making it progressively harder. Your goal is to match the sequence correctly to reach the highest level possible! 🚀

### 🎮How to Play:

- **Start the Game:** Press any key to begin the game.
- **Watch the Sequence:** The game will flash a sequence of colors. Pay close attention!
- **Repeat the Sequence:** Click on the buttons in the correct order to match the sequence.
- **Level Up:** Each time you correctly match the sequence, you advance to the next level, and the sequence gets longer.
- **Game Over:** If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

### 📚Features:

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Engage with a dynamic sequence of flashing colors.
- **Score Display:** Your highest scores are recorded and displayed on a separate high score page.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Persistent Scores:** High scores are saved using localStorage, so you can come back and try to beat your best score.

### 📱 Tech Stack:
- **HTML:** Structure of the game pages.
- **CSS:** Styling for a visually appealing game interface.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic and interactivity.
